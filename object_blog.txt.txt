2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
Ans:

Object is a nonpremetive data type in Javascript, which is haing  key : value pair, which is placed in flower brases{}.
eg: obj={
    key:value,
    key1:value1,
    ......
}

For example, let’s create an object named myCar and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:

var myCar = {
myCar.make = 'Ford';
myCar.model = 'Mustang';
myCar.year = 1969;
myCar.color; // undefined [Unassigned properties of an object are undefined (and not null).]
}

You access the value of an object with a simple dot-notation:
objectName.keynameName
eg: mycar.make

Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation, we can use space, hyphen, or that starts with a number in propertyname can only be accesses using bracket notation

eg:
myCar['make of car'] = 'Ford';
myCar['model of car'] = 'Mustang';
myCar['year of manfacuture'] = 1969;

If we want to add new property to our object then we can add it using dot notation bracket notation(if property name has space/hyphen/starts with number)

eg:

mycar.color='red'
my car['seat capaity']= 4;


If we want to delete any property then we can delete it using detete objectName.keynameName

eg: delete mycar.make
